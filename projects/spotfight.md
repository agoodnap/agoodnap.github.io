## The Game
Spotfight is a 3v3 top-down action game, where players have to work together and gather information using their limited
vision to outmaneuver the enemy. In a tug-of-war style match, the teams must best each other in a variety of fast-paced **encounters** with different objectives,
such as **delivering a payload**, scoring highest in a **team death-match** and holding a zone in the style of **king of the hill**.
Whoever manages to create a two-point lead, or is in the lead when the match time runs out, is the winner!

Spotfight started development during our masters degree at the Salzburg University of Applied Sciences,
and is currently on track to release on **Steam** in late 2022.

The game's steam page can be found [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1981510/Spotfight/).

## Development
Spotfight's development started with a team of seven people, unfortunate circumstances led to the team shrinking to four: 2 Programmers, 1 Artist & 1 Sound Designer.
We developed the game Unreal Engine 4 to build knowledge about the engine and it's capabilities, and to further our skill in regards to developing multiplayer games and systems.
Together we designed, coded, modeled & composed every aspect of the game over the course of ~2 years during our masters degree.

While the project has already been graded by the university, we decided to continue development on our own time and are working hard towards it's eventual release.

## My Responsitibilities
As programmer, my main focus was in implementing the games mechanics and systems such as:
- **Character Mechanics**:
  - Character Movement and Health (walking, dashing, character health & death)
  - Shooting Mechanics (An extendable weapon system)
- **Game Systems**:
  - Encounter System
  - Designing and implementing the delivery- and deathmatch-encounters
- **Online Multiplayer**:
  - Using Unreal's replication & RPC system to ensure smooth online gameplay
  - Implementing a system to synchronize the loading of levels on clients and servers

In addition, I worked with artists to communicate our needs and smoothly implement their created assets into the game.
